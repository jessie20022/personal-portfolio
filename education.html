        <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem">
          The following section is dedicated to the college courses I've taken
          at UMD! I tend to get false impressions or hear different things from
          other people about these classes, but I want to record and reflect on
          my own experience. It's mostly for personal recollection, sort of like
          a school journal, but feel free to read on! Courses will be listed in
          order by semesters and course name. The number in parenthesis
          represents the number of credits the course is.

              <li>CMSC131: Object-Oriented Programming I</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Introduction to programming and computer
                science. Emphasizes understanding and implementation of
                applications using object-oriented techniques. Develops skills
                such as program design and testing as well as implementation of
                programs using a graphical IDE. Programming done in Java.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: One of my more relaxing core classes, since I had
                prior programming experience. The projects were really fun to
                think about too, since they were mostly like logic puzles.
              </p>
              <li>HNUH100: Gateway Seminar</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: First-semester orientation and exploration
                seminar required of all UH students.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: We read Weapons of Math Destruction sorta like a
                book club. We also explored ancient text/maps, and it was quite
                interesting. I also became friends with a really cool guy.

                HNUH248Y: How Do You "Man Up?": Men, Masculinity, and Mental
                Health
              </li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Students in this interdisciplinary course
                will explore multi-layered issues related to privilege and
                oppression through their own life experiences via exposure to
                theory, research, film, memoirs, and current events. Students
                will evaluate and critique common assumptions about the meaning
                and experiences of privilege and oppression using
                Intersectionality theory as a guiding framework. The human
                experience related to various social identities (i.e., race,
                gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, social class,
                religion, age, and ability) will be addressed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Super fun and interesting with the help of the
                professor. One of the more interesting units was probably
                learning about the stereotypes.
              </p>
              <li>MATH240: Introduction to Linear Algebra</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Basic concepts of linear algebra: vector
                spaces, applications to line and plane geometry, linear
                equations and matrices, similar matrices, linear
                transformations, eigenvalues, determinants and quadratic forms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Really enjoyed the eigenvalue/eigenvector chapter;
                solving those problems were fun. I also liked the beginning
                where we learned matrices. It became difficult when we started
                learning about transformations though :( definitely half-assed
                and need to review that unit.
              </p>
              <li>PHYS121: Fundamentals of Phyics I</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: The first part of a two-semester course in
                general physics treating the fields of mechanics, heat, sound,
                electricity, magnetism, optics, and modern physics. Together
                with PHYS122, this generally satisfies the minimum requirement
                of medical and dental schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: I took it because I considered going pre-med?
                Which... that idea didn't age quite well haha. Anyhow, it was
                basically Physics 1 so it wasn't too bad. I learned most of the
                material in high school, so the course was basically a review.
                The downcurve stressed me out, but it was okay! Also met and
                befriended one of the best people in that class, and he was my
                lab partner.

              <p>
                Course Description: A study of how perception, self-concept, and
                verbal and nonverbal communications affect the communication
                process as it emerges in the workplace. The course provides
                skill training in speech writing, public speaking, group
                communication, interpersonal communication, listening, and
                responding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: I had a lot of fun: I got to do 3/4 presentations on
                topics I was very familiar with. It was stressful having to do
                four presentations in 3 weeks, not to mention taking a midterm
                and final. Since I took the class online, it was a bit less
                nervewrecking presenting over a Zoom than in real life. However,
                I did learn all about Zoom etiquette and how to properly be
                interviewed online.

                emphasis on cellular and molecular biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: I took bio and bio lab so I could take more
                neuroscience classes in the future, but this class was a great
                first step. Turns out I knew some of the fundamentals from high
                school biology, but I still definitely learned a lot of new
                material such as the details of photosynthesis and cellular
                respiration.

              <p>
                Course Description: Basic laboratory principles of biology with

              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Do I think that the expected time spent on this 1
                credit class should be 10 hours per week is absurd? Yes.
                Otherwise, make the class more credits plz :) In all realness,
                the multi-week labs became incredibly difficult whereas the
                first five one-week labs weren't too strenous (in fact they were
                more so busy work in comparison).
              </p>
              <li>CMSC132: Object-Oriented Programming II (4)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Introduction to use of computers to solve
                problems using software engineering principles. Design, build,
                test, and debug medium -size software systems and learn to use
                relevant tools. Use object-oriented methods to create effective
                and efficient problem solutions. Use and implement application
                programming interfaces (APIs). Programming done in Java.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Learning all of the data structures was definitely a
                challenge. I think ArrayLists and Hash/Tree sets are my
                favorites, but I've gotta be more familiarized with binary
                search trees. Linked lists aren't bad too, but it's in the same
                boat as binary search trees.
              </p>
              <li>CMSC250: Discrete Structures (4)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Fundamental mathematical concepts related to
                computer science, including finite and infinite sets, relations,
                functions, and propositional logic. Introduction to other
                techniques, modeling and solving problems in computer science.
                Introduction to permutations, combinations, graphs, and trees
                with selected applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: One of my top three classes at UMD as of May 2021.
                As I write this, my final grade hasn't come out. The class was
                definitely a challenge for many including myself, but I loved
                how much I learned and how the class was taught with lectures
                T/TH and weekly homeworks.
              </p>
              <li>HNUH248A: Identity, Places, & Spaces (3)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Students in this interdisciplinary course
                will explore multi-layered issues related to privilege and
                oppression through their own life experiences via exposure to
                theory, research, film, memoirs, and current events. Students

                Reflection: "My eyes have been opened" is the saying I'd use to
                describe what this class has done for me.
              </p>
              <li>MUSC140: Music Fundamentals I (3)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Introductory theory course. Notation,
                scales, intervals, triads, rhythm, form and basic aural skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Music composition is the bane of my existence: one
                of the most difficult aspects of this class and classical music.
                This really surprised me, given my classical background in
                music. Music theory isn't too bad though.

                inter-organizational and intra-organizational coordination of
                core business processes. Emphasis is on cross-functional
                integration and the efficient and effective management of core
                processes with an emphasis on marketing, operations and supply
                chain management.

                Reflection: I felt like I was familiar with a lot of the
                material to begin with. From AP Macroeconomics with Kachur and
                my FBLA projects, the first half of the class was full of
                content I was mostly familiar with. THe second part includes
                financial, accounting, and promotions topics--topics I'm not
                familiar with.

                programs and the operating system/hardware. Major topics include
                C programming, introductory systems programming, and assembly
                language. Other concepts covered include UNIX, machine data
                representation, thread management, optimization, and virtual
                memory. Programming is done in the Linux Environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: So far the most difficult class I've taken at UMD. I
                know so many people blame the instructor for this one, but I
                think we all could have studied harder. Subtle flex, but I've
                had a 4.0 for 8 years. And this is the first class that I'm
                getting a B in, post-curve. Pre-curve, I have a 65.something and
                the average is a 63.something. I could go on and on about how it
                was a different professor making everything more difficult and
                unusual as people did on rate my professor, but I won't.
                Genuinly just a difficult class that is quite different from all
                the other CS classes so far and it requires different attention.
                I'm really hoping I learned from this experience and change my
                approach to the rest of the semesters.

                HNUH268Y: The Politics of Disability: Life Narratives & Identity
                (3)
              </li>
              <p>
                Course Description: The politics of disability are fraught and
                contentious. This course takes up the experience of disability
                by asking how and why differently-abled bodies are excluded,
                marginalized, or threatened. Students will examine these
                questions through the psychosocial and cultural history of
                disability, as well as through life narratives and real-world
                exploration. Beginning with the history of disability, students
                will gain an understanding of how current disability identity
                and culture has develop in the US. Students will experience and
                also produce personal life narratives related to bodily politics
                and gain insights that help them navigate the politics and
                participate in the change-making advocacy of disability.

                Reflection: I feel like I've been pretty lucky with the honors
                classes I've chosen. All of the classes I've chosen have been
                entirely reasonable with workload and expectations. I know some
                of the other classes are so much harder and so much heavier in
                workload and extremely high grading expectations. I feel like
                this class was so great and educated me so much on disability. I
                also had a super fun time working on the final project.

              <li>INST123: Databases for All (3)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: An introduction to relational databases for
                students with no previous programming experience. Provides a
                means for students of diverse backgrounds to successfully learn
                how to store, retrieve, and maintain data in relational
                databases. Topics include a brief comparison of database systems
                with an emphasis on relational databases, fundamental relational
                database concepts, and data types. Includes technical approaches
                to accessing information stored in relational databases.

              <p>
                Reflection: Great introduction to SQL. To be honest, I was wary
                about taking this class because I had dropped ENES100 for this
                and wasn't sure about the workload. Thankfully, it wasn't bad at
                all. The workload was entirely manageable and there wasn't a
                final exam at the end, which saved me studying time since I had
                two finals already. The group project honestly was kinda nice
                because I got to meet some other people, but it wasn't something
                that you could blow off.

                Reflection: One of the most enjoyable classes. I think it was
                the way that the class was structured, but it didn't seem too
                difficult. The numerous examples provided definitely helped with
                my success in the class. Mazzullo is the best!

              <li>CMSC330: Organization of Programming Languages</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: A study of programming languages, including
                their syntax, semantics, and implementation. Several different
                models of languages are discussed, including dynamic, scripting
                (e.g., Ruby, Python) functional (e.g., OCaml, Haskell, Scheme),
                and memory safe systems programming (e.g., Rust). Explores
                language features such as formal syntax, scoping and binding of
                variables, higher-order programming, typing, and type
                polymorphism. Introduces finite automata, context free grammar,
                parsing, lambda calculus, and basics of security attacks and
                software security.

              <p>
                Reflection: This was much more interesting than CMSC330, and I
                definitely think that this class is incredibly beneficial for
                future software engineering interviews. A lot of the things we
                learned in this class, including sorting methods and time
                complexity are things we need to know as software engineers.
                Super important and interesting class.

                HNUH268A: Arbitrating our Bodily Rights: What it Means to
                Consent
              </li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Both American law and conventional morality
                support the view that human beings have bodily rights - ones we
                can waive by giving another person our consent to do what would
                otherwise be a rights violation. Yet, debate about the
                sovereignty of an individual's body and the potential rights of
                others--including the state--over our bodies lies at the core of
                some of the most contentious issues facing us as a society. This
                class will investigate the thorny debates that pertain to
                consent in sexual relations, medicine and research, and bodily
                markets. What types threats, offers, or cognitive incapacities
                undermine true consent? How do we evaluate the moral or legal
                significance of bodily rights when they come into tension with
                the government's interest? After evaluating arguments, exploring
                distinctions, and using philosophical tools to arrive at
                reasoned conclusions about consent, students will learn to apply
                these conceptual tools to cases from fiction and current events.

                Reflection: This class was also another interesting and
                challenging class. I didn't really know anything, but I learned
                a lot by the end of this course. The course also gave me a lot
                more awareness to things happening with rights and consent, and
                I really enjoyed this class despite it being difficult for me.

                Reflection: I wish there was more emphasis on classical music,
