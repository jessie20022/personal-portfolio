      Hi! I'm Jessica, a senior at the University of Maryland. I was born and
      raised in Maryland, but I love to travel and explore new places. I also
      love to learn new things--especially if it's through a hands-on
      activity.
    </p>

      <h3>currently...</h3>
      <p>
        At UMD, I study computer science. I would also love to be involved in
        research for computer and data science in the future. Along the way,
        I've met some amazing educators who gave me unparalleled instruction
        and opportunities, leading to my decision to double minor in
        statistics and business analytics. While I love studying these three
        subjects, I also have an interest for neuroscience and psychology that
        I developed in high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the school year, I was able to finish some projects such as Squirrel.io and an analysis on UMD grade
        data, which you can find on my resume. These projects were great for me to learn Swift and iOS app development
        as well as learning the ins and outs of Python and graphing.
        I have been working on personal projects such as creating PyTracker, a webapp that helps track one's health
        statistics. The progress is quite slow, but not sedentary.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, I'm interning with Akira Technologies where I am a Data
        Science Analyst Intern. Here, I am working with another intern to
        create a Python project for data pipeline observability.

      <h3>previously...</h3>
      <p>
        This past summer, I interned at <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a> as a software engineer intern. My
        main project here was to perform chaos testing on the header and footer by injecting API errors. With my
        results, we could see if the website was
        responding favorably or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        This past summer of 2022, I interned at Motorola Solutions as a
        Pre-Sales System Engineer. During my time in Chicago, my team taught
        me how to design and quote radio frequency systems. I also got to work
        in Google Apps Scripts (Javascript) and code various automation tools
        to help my team make quoting faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the spring of 2021, I worked as an intern at Exerceo in a
        professional mentorship program while using Linux and text editors on
        Fedora in Java and JavaScript in order to create an inventory that can
        store items.
      </p>
      <p>
        In high school, I participated in FIRST robotics where I helped with
        the design and building of our robot as well as conduct team bonding
        exercises to help improve everyone's communication.

      <h3>for fun...</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond my academic interests, I love to spent my time playing tennis,
        piano, and a few games such as Valorant, Fortnite, Minecraft, and Clash Royale.
        With friends, I love to go to new places, whether it be educational or
        for fun, to create memories and take pictures (scroll down!). For
        personal improvement, I like to write in my journal and improve my
        Chinese.
